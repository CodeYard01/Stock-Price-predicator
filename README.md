# Stock Price Predictor

A simple stock price prediction tool using machine learning with TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Keras. The project fetches data from Yahoo Finance.

## Project Overview

The Stock Price Predictor leverages machine learning techniques to analyze historical stock data and make predictions about future stock prices. The primary focus is on implementing various algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and model evaluation for accurate predictions.

## Features

- Historical stock data analysis
- Machine learning models for stock price prediction
- Data fetched from Yahoo Finance
- Data visualization using Matplotlib
- Utilizes TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, and Keras

## Project Structure

- `Main.py`: Main script for fetching data and running the prediction model

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow scikit-learn pandas matplotlib numpy keras
    ```

2. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python Main.py
    ```

    This will fetch data from Yahoo Finance and run the stock price prediction model.
